	<p>Thrissur Pooram was the brainchild of Raja Rama Varma, famously known as Sakthan Thampuran, 
	the Maharaja of Cochin (1790–1805). Before the start of Thrissur Pooram, the largest temple festival in Kerala was 
	the one-day festival held at Aarattupuzha known as Arattupuzha Pooram. Temples in and around the city of Thrissur 
	were regular participants. In the year 1798 because of incessant rains, the temples with from Thrissur were late 
	for the Arattupuzha Pooram and were denied access to the Pooram procession. Feeling embarrassed and angered by the
	 denial, the temple[clarification needed] authorities raised the issue with Sakthan Thampuran.
	</p>	
	<p>This made him take the decision to unify the 10 temples situated around Vadakkunnathan Temple and organized the
	 celebration of Thrissur Pooram as a mass festival. He invited temples with their deities to the city of Thrissur 
	 to pay obeisance to Lord Vadakkunnathan (Lord Siva), the presiding deity of the Vadakkunnathan Temple. Something
	  unique about this festival is that everything used in the festival is made fresh every year from scratch. There 
	  are people who are given the duty to craft the umbrellas and the nettipattam.
	</p>
	<p>Very many stories are told and retold about the origin of Thrissur pooram. Thrissur pooram is 200 plus years young 
	and before that the "Arattupuzha pooram" conducted at Arattupuzha, some 16 km away from Vadakumnathan was the biggest 
	temple festival of Kerala. All the temples participating Thrissur pooram and Kuttanellore pooram was the regular 
	participant of "Arattupuzha pooram" .Once these temples were delayed to attend the festival due to heavy rain or so and
	then chief of Peruvanam Gramam denied the entry. As an act of reprisal Thrissur Naduvazhi the chief of Vadakunnathan, 
	known as Yogadiripad and Kuttanellur Naduvazhi started the pooram in Thrissur. Later due to some reasons the 
	Kuttanellur Naduvazhi disassociated the celebration at Thrissur. Since the withdrawal of Kuttanellur Naduvazhi the 
	glamour of the pooram was lost and the two 'Naduvazhies' began to treat each other as enemies. It was in this juncture 
	the former ruler of Cochin, His Highness Ramavarma Raja, popularly known as Sakthan Thampuran (1751-1805 AD) became the
	Maharaja of Kochi. Sakthan Thampuran unified the 10 temples situated around Vadakumnathan temple and took steps to 
	celebrate Thrissur Pooram as a mass festival. Sakthan Thampuran classified the participants in to two groups the 
	western and the Eastern The western group consist of Thiruvambady, Kanimangalam, Laloor, Ayyanthole, and Nethilakkavu 
	temples. Paramekkavu, Karamukku, Chembukavu. Choorakottukavu and Panamukkamppilly comes under eastern group. The
	Maharaja re - organized the annual festival in its present form in front of Vadakumnathan. Sakthan Thampuran also 
	directed the main temples at Thrissur, Paramekkavu and Thiruvambady to extent all support and help to other poorams 
	which are coming from 2 to 10 KM. away from Vadakumnathan temple. Recently the Kanimangalam changed to eastern side. 
	The event management of the whole pooram was chalked out by His Highness Sakthan Thamburan and followed iota till now.
